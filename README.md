Throughout the program, I had the privilege of working on eight intriguing projects, each meticulously designed to enhance understanding and practical application of key data science concepts. Below is a brief overview of each project:

1. **Housing in Mexico:** Analyzing a dataset of 21,000 properties to determine the primary influence on real estate prices: property size or location.

2. **Apartment Sales in Buenos Aires:** Developing a linear regression model to predict apartment prices in Argentina.

3. **Air Quality in Nairobi:** Building an ARMA time-series model to forecast particulate matter levels in Kenya.

4. **Earthquake Damage in Nepal:** Constructing logistic regression and decision tree models to predict earthquake damage to buildings.

5. **Bankruptcy in Poland:** Building random forest and gradient boosting models to predict company bankruptcies.

6. **Customer Segmentation in the US:** Employing a k-means clustering model to categorize US consumers into distinct groups.

7. **A/B Testing at WorldQuant University:** Conducting a chi-square test to evaluate the impact of email communication on program enrollment at WQU.

8. **Volatility Forecasting in India:** Constructing a GARCH time series model to predict asset volatility.

I extend my sincere gratitude to WorldQuant for providing an exceptional learning experience. The program's comprehensive curriculum and hands-on projects have equipped me with practical skills and a deep understanding of data science techniques.
